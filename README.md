# Customer-Churn-Project

## Introduction
This particular dataset intrigued be because I have been in the customer service industry and currently work within retail. My aspirations are to become an effective Data Scientist where I can utilize my skill-set to bring reliable insight to my business partner(s) where they can take my analysys into high consideration when making decisions to strengthen the whole operation. The dataset that I have analyzed for you today represents information gathered by Telecom of their customers utilization of their product in a variety of features while also describing if that customer churned or not. The goal for this project was to come up with a model that effectively utilized certain features to accurately predict whether or not the customer would continue services or cancel them.

### Overview
Dataset contains twenty different columns consisting of 3333 datapoints. The target of this model was 'churn'. The goal to this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately tell whether or not a customer will continue services or cancel based on features given such as: voice mail plan, international plan, total call charge, total evening minutes, etc.

### Data Usage
Kaggle sources CSV file-https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset
Consisted of 20 Features, 3333 Data points, and the target variable was 'Churn' (note: imbalanced rationfor target was 85/15 split

### Modeling
The model that was observed to be the most accurate of the four observed was decision trees. The baseline was logistic regression. Comparing the two, decision trees will most likely have the higher accuracy more times than not when comparing it to log regression. The accuracy for decision trees was 91% compared to its counterpart at 75%.
